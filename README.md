# Hermes
    disclaimer :
        I chose this name because I like Hermes, the Greek god of the messenger.


### About project:
    Hermes is a project for learning about messaging systems and distributed systems.


### Impressions:
    1. Starting build a messaging system connection.
    2. Abstract the MS, because you can change this in the future.
    3. Define a domain to put models shared between services.
    4. Each service should have a Dockerfile and main.go
    5. Define a docker-compose.yml for services.
    6. Define a Makefile for build and run services.
    7. Each service should have your own API.
